FAQs (What is Transfer Learning? A Key to Faster AI Training)
1. What are the common applications of transfer learning?
Transfer learning is commonly applied in image classification, natural language processing, speech recognition, and medical diagnosis. It helps when there is limited data for a specific task by reusing knowledge from a related domain, improving model performance.

2. What is an example of a transfer learning model?
A well-known example is BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), a pre-trained language model used for NLP tasks like sentiment analysis or text summarization by fine-tuning it on specific datasets.

3. What is the difference between transfer learning and deep learning?
Deep learning involves training a model from scratch using large datasets, while transfer learning adapts a pre-trained model to new tasks, speeding up the process and improving efficiency by reusing existing knowledge.

4. What are the stages of transfer learning?
The stages of transfer learning include:

Pre-training
Feature extraction or fine-tuning
Training on the target task
